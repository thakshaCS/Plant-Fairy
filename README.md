# Plant-Fairy

## Introduction
Plant Fairy is an app plant owners can use to monitor and take care of their plants remotely and in-person. It has three features:

- Greenhouse : Display plants that have linked to their app. Each plant  may have  an exclamation symbol to indicate it needs attention and a link symbol indicating that its linked to a device.

- Plant Academy: A page for plant owners to learn about their plants from articles written by credible people. Each article lists history about the plant andplant care practices. Also each article has a quiz that users can use to test what they have learned.

- Plant Community: A place for plant-owners to discuss, share concerns and provide support. It is formated similary to Reddit, users can upvote/downvote posts, reply to comments/post and add tags to post. The credibility of a users response or post on the form is based on whether they have a  plant care badge.

## Problem Statment

Plant owners with a busy lifestyle and minimal plant care experience want an easy and efficient way to identify issues with their indoor houseplants’ health and receive assistance with adapting their care practices to the unique needs of each plant.


## Formative Studies

We conducted questionnaires and interviews to better understand the problem. Based on the formative studies we developed the persona of a plant owners.

Also based on our finding we created an experince map to help us develop job stories and design requirments.

## Design Concepts and Prototypes

After brainstoroming possible solutions to the problem, we finalized on a solution that drew from the advantages of each solution. We created high and low level storyboard to demonstrate how planter owners will use and iteract with our app.
