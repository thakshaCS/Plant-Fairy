- Greenhouse : Display plants that have linked to their app. Each plant  may have  an exclamation symbol to indicate it needs attention and a link symbol indicating that its linked to a device.

- Plant Academy: A page for plant owners to learn about their plants from articles written by credible people. Each article lists history about the plant andplant care practices. Also each article has a quiz that users can use to test what they have learned.

- Plant Community: A place for plant-owners to discuss, share concerns and provide support. It is formated similary to Reddit, users can upvote/downvote posts, reply to comments/post and add tags to post. The credibility of a users response or post on the form is based on whether they have a  plant care badge.

## Formative Studies
A study revealed that around 73% of Americans killed at least one plant in a year, with 36.3% killing three or more plants in one year (Statistica Research Department, 2022). Statistics in both the United States and Canada reveal that more indoor plants are being sold each year (Bharti, 2019). Additionally, there is an increasing interest in multiple different families and types of houseplants (Figure 1.1.1 below), each with unique care needs including watering, light exposure, soil type, and so on (Economist Data Team, 2018). With more houseplants being sold each year and houseplant deaths being a prevalent problem, it suggests more individuals will encounter the problem of adequately caring for and keeping their houseplants alive.

We conducted questionnaires and interviews to better understand the problem. Based on the formative studies there we developed two personas a plant owners and a plant sitter:
