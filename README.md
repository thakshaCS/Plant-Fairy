A study revealed that around 73% of Americans killed at least one plant in a year, with 36.3% killing three or more plants in one year (Statistica Research Department, 2022). Statistics in both the United States and Canada reveal that more indoor plants are being sold each year (Bharti, 2019). Additionally, there is an increasing interest in multiple different families and types of houseplants (Figure 1.1.1 below), each with unique care needs including watering, light exposure, soil type, and so on (Economist Data Team, 2018). With more houseplants being sold each year and houseplant deaths being a prevalent problem, it suggests more individuals will encounter the problem of adequately caring for and keeping their houseplants alive.

We conducted questionnaires and interviews to better understand the problem. Based on the formative studies there we developed two personas a plant owners and a plant sitter:

We also created an experince map to develop job stories and design requirments.
