# Plant-Fairy

## Introduction
Plant Fairy is an app plant owners can use to monitor and take care of their plants remotely and in-person. It has three features:

- Greenhouse : Display plants that have linked to their app. Each plant  may have  an exclamation symbol to indicate it needs attention and a link symbol indicating that its linked to a device.

- Plant Academy: A page for plant owners to learn about their plants from articles written by credible people. Each article lists history about the plant andplant care practices. Also each article has a quiz that users can use to test what they have learned.

- Plant Community: A place for plant-owners to discuss, share concerns and provide support. It is formated similary to Reddit, users can upvote/downvote posts, reply to comments/post and add tags to post. The credibility of a users response or post on the form is based on whether they have a  plant care badge.

### Try Out Plant Fairy

## Problem Statment

Plant owners with a busy lifestyle and minimal plant care experience want an easy and efficient way to identify issues with their indoor houseplants’ health and receive assistance with adapting their care practices to the unique needs of each plant.


## Formative Studies

We conducted questionnaires and interviews to better understand the problem. Based on the formative studies we developed the persona of a plant owners.

Also based on our finding we created an experince map to help us develop job stories and design requirments.

## Design Concepts and Prototypes

After brainstoroming possible solutions to the problem, we finalized on a solution that drew from the advantages of each solution. We created high and low level storyboard to demonstrate how planter owners will use and iteract with our app.

### High-Level Storyboard

### Evaluvation of Low Fideltiy Prototype

We evaluvated our paper prototype by conducting think aloud and heurstic evaluvations.

#### Think Aloud

Some of the context/tasks provided to the participant in the think aloud section are:

Task: Register and Add A Plant
Imagine that you are a plant owner, and you are seeking to improve your plant care routine and practices. You expect to learn more about the plant you currently own. 
Now, I would like you to show me how you would add a snake plant to this app. Feel free to explore the interface as you see fit. 


Task: Remedy Plant Issues Via App + Hardware
Imagine that you are a plant owner, and you are seeking to use plant-care tools to improve your plant-care practices. You expect to be able to adjust water and light levels through the app. Assume all plant hardware has already been added to the plant and app.Now, I would like you to show me how you would water the plant through the app. Then, I would like you to show me how you would adjust light levels through the app. Feel free to explore the interface as you see fit. 

Task: Interact with Other Plant Owners
Imagine that you are a plant owner, and you are seeking other plant owners to connect with on best practices and tips.
Now, I would like you to show me how you would engage with other plant owners through the Plant Community discussion forum. Specifically, please show me how you would interact with an existing post (i.e., view, comment). Feel free to explore the interface as you see fit. 


#### Heuristic Evaluvation

We categorized the finding from the heurstic evaluvation in what heuristics they violated and the severity of the issue.

The findings from these evaluvation were taken into account to improve our prototype.
